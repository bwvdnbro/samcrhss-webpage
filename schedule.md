# Preliminary schedule

Below is a preliminary schedule for the school. A more detailed schedule
will be posted in due time.

Currently, the following people are scheduled to lecture (this list is preliminary and might change): Kenny Wood (St. Andrews), Tim
Harries (Exeter), Barbara Ercolano (Munich), Antonia Bevan (UCL), Bert
Vandenbroucke (St. Andrews), Stuart Sim (QUB), Michiel Hogerheijde
(Leiden), Ollie Lomax (ESA), Kees Dullemond (Heidelberg), and Volker Bromm (Texas).

Day 1:
: Introduction to MCRT techniques (Wood &amp; Bevan)
  sampling from probability distribution functions; scattering albedo
  and phase functions; spherical and plane parallel isotropic
  scattering codes; intensity moments &amp; radiation pressure; 3D linear
  cartesian grid code. Afternoon tutorial sessions on MCRT.

Day 2:
: Introductory lectures on finite volume
  hydrodynamics codes (Vandenbroucke); Sod shock test problem;
  Kelvin-Helmholtz iinstabilities; writing a 3D hydro code in
  Python. Radiation hydrodynamics (Harries, Bromm); massively
  parallel computing

Day 3:
: Using rad hydro codes in your research (Wood,
  Harries, Vandenbroucke, Sim, Lomax); talks on specific codes

Day 4:
: Codes for producing synthetic observations
  (Ercolano, Wood, Hogerheijde, Dullemond, Lomax). Radiative
  equilibrium: reprocessing by gas and dust; techniques for optically
  thin and thick regions; merging Monte Carlo with diffusion
  techniques. Photoionization: ionization equilibrium and temperature
  calculations within MCRT; atomic databases; x-rays and high energy
  processes; effects of dust on H{\sc ii} regions. Non Local
  Thermodynamic Equilibrium Line Transfer with velocity fields
